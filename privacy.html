    <h1>Privacy Policy for Image SEO Analyzer</h1>
    <p><em>Last Updated: [Date of submission]</em></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to Image SEO Analyzer ("the Extension"), a browser extension developed by Lutfor Pro. 
        Your privacy is critically important to us. This privacy policy explains what data the Extension 
        interacts with and, more importantly, what it does not do.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection and Usage: No Data is Collected</h2>
    <p><strong>The Image SEO Analyzer extension is designed with a "privacy-first" approach. It does not collect, store, share, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Analysis:</strong> All analysis of images (ALT text, file names, dimensions, etc.) is performed locally within your browser on the current web page you are viewing.</li>
        <li><strong>No External Communication:</strong> The extension does not send any of the analyzed page data or your browsing activity to any external servers, including those of the developer. All processing remains on your computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Storage for Settings:</strong> The extension uses Chrome's local storage API (`chrome.storage.local`) for one purpose only: to save your preference for the "Show on-page highlights" toggle (on or off). This setting is stored exclusively in your browser and is not accessible to anyone else.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Export Feature:</strong> The "Download CSV" feature generates a file directly in your browser from the data on the current webpage. This data is saved directly to your computer's downloads folder without being sent over the network to the developer or any third party.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Permissions Justification</h2>
    <p>The extension requests the minimum permissions necessary for its core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>`activeTab` & `scripting`</strong>: Required to read the content of the web page you are currently viewing to analyze the images. This permission is only active for the tab you are on when you use the extension.</li>
        <li><strong>`storage`</strong>: Required to save the state of the on/off toggle switch between browser sessions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy in the future to reflect changes in the extension's functionality. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the extension listing on the Chrome Web Store.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
        If you have any questions about this privacy policy or the practices of this extension, please contact the developer, Lutfor Pro, 
        through the support options provided on the Chrome Web Store listing.
    </p>
